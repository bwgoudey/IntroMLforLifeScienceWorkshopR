        "\n",
        "There will be a number of models, measures and algorithms that will be used and will be briefly explained in the accompanying tutorial but will not be covered in detail. The tidymodels documentation will be valuable here (https://www.tidymodels.org/find/all/)\n",

        "The notebook assumes familiarity with R and tidyverse and a passing familiarity with the ggplot packages.
