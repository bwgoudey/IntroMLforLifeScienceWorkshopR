## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Read the dataset and make sure it's similar to sklearn's format
source('./helpers.R')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
diabetes_df = load_diabetes_data(n_random=40)
```

```{r report}
create_report(diabetes_df$original)
```


```{r}
# Setting up the model specification
logit_spec <- logistic_reg(mode = "classification", penalty = 0, engine = "glm")

# Setting up the workflow
workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(logit_spec) %>%
  add_formula(y ~ .) # Any variable on the left-hand side of the tilde (~) is considered the model outcome (here, arr_delay). On the right-hand side of the tilde are the predictors. Variables may be listed by name, or you can use the dot (.) to indicate all other variables as predictors.

# Fitting the model
fit <- workflow %>%
  fit(data = diabetes_df$original)

# Making predictions
yp_training <- predict(fit, new_data = diabetes_df$original, type = "prob") %>%
  pull(.pred_0)

yp_testing <- predict(fit, new_data = diabetes_df$simulated, type = "prob") %>%
  pull(.pred_1)

# Plot training and external validation ROC curves
p1 <- plot_roc(diabetes_df$original$y, yp_training, "Training")
p2 <- plot_roc(diabetes_df$simulated$y, yp_testing, "External")

# Print or plot the ROC curves
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
